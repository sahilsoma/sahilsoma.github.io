                As part of my graduating programme, I completed IES. I used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL to construct this easy-to-understand project. On XAMPP, the development was carried out. The goal of the project was to create an intranet-based tool that will let a college or other educational institution effectively assess and manage student records.<br><br>

              <p class="category-body">
                This project was created in order to fulfil a requirement for my Masters degree programme, which required two projects be created: a major project, which I eventually created, and a mini-project like this one. The project's major goal is to make it easy for anyone to quickly create a resume and maintain as many resumes as they'd like at once, so job seekers may target each position with a uniquely tailored CV instead of sending general resumes to all possible jobs. The XAMPP environment was used to construct the project using Bootstrap and the PHP-Maria database stack.<br><br>

                I created this project as a major component of my master's programme. The project was created to address a significant problem that majority of household in India and various other nations experiences. The issue I'm attempting to address here has to do with handwritten notes and textbooks that aren't treated with the appropriate respect and disposed of once a student passes a class and moves on to the next one. With this effort, I aimed to increase awareness of the problem. A suitable approach that can assist in addressing the trashing of beneficial study resources, redistributing them for maximum application, and lessening the strain on natural resources was also put forth. The project was developed using Bootstrap, PHP/MariaDB, and some Stackoverflow code.<br><br>

                It started out as a kind of digital yellow pages for the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The central idea behind this project was to create a platform where local businesses and professionals could create and manage their information with respect to tourism and business growth. I started the project in collaboration with two other people who were not familiar with coding at the time, and their main role was to promote the platform in local businesses so that we could get initial users for our platform. The project was developed in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and Maria DB. <strong>The primary goal of this project was to create a platform solely dedicated to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, as well as to give users enough freedom to safely and quickly alter information.Â </strong><br><br>

                I created SikhMatch.in as a project for a customer. Similar to how social media functions, the client wanted to develop a free sikh materimonial service where all amritdhari sikhs may communicate with one another for the materimonial process. When I stopped working on the site for the customer for personal reasons, it was largely finished.

                I developed the site with bootstrap as frontend and PHP/Maria as backend. <br><br>

                This project I worked on was for an ayurvedic herpes therapy that was recommended by an ayurvedacharya over 25 years ago and is now provided by a licenced Indian medicine practitioner. The majority of the project was frontend, however there were a few features like a contact form and direct emailing that needed data administration and gathering. This project was created using PHP and Bootstrap.<br><br>

                I recently finished a straightforward frontend project for a client who runs a small business. They got in touch with me because they wanted to have an online presence. Although the company was founded in 1999, they had not previously considered creating a website. I used Bootstrap to create the website and PHP to add mailing functions.<br><br>
